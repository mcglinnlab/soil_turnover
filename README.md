# soil_turnover

This goal of this project is to examine the spatial scaling of
turnover in below-ground production of biomass by roots, 
rhizomorphs, and mycorrohize

Key questions we would like to address:

1) are spatial and temporal patterns of turnover similar or different
2) how do different metrics of turnover differ
3) are patterns of turnover scale invariance
4) how do different components of the below ground community 
   differ from one another?
